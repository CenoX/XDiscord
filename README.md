Coming soon once app goes stable.

## Installation 

- Drag the app into your Applications folder. (this is required, it will not function otherwise)
- Go to System Preferences > Extensions
- Click 'xcode editor' in the list that shows up.
- Check the box next to 'XDiscord Extension'
- Launch Xcode, and rich presence should start showing up in your Discord client.  
   XDiscord can now be configured by going to Editor > XDiscord > Preferences from Xcode itself.

## Development

Read [here](DEVELOPMENT.md) about how the project works and is set up.

## App store

No. Read [here](DEVELOPMENT.md) why. (the gist of it is that we can't talk to Discord from [the sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html))
