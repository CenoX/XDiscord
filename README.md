### AssetRenderer

Icons can be generated with the `AssetRenderer` CLI tool included in this repo.  
This tool creates 512x512 icons for each file type that XCode can open, it's filenames being a hashed version of the [UTI's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier).  
Unless a major new version of XCode is released, or you wish to set up your own discord application using this code, you'll probably have no use for it.
